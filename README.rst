*Currency Converter* is a simple Gtk application for converting currencies. 
It's written in Python_ making use of the new PyGObject_ bindings.

The application is currently using the exchangerate-api.com_ webservice for
the currency convertions.

*Currency Converter* is developed on Linux and is primarily targeting the
GNOME_ desktop environment, but should run equaly well on platforms with the
necessary dependencies available.
